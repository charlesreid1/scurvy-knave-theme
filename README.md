# scurvy knave pelican theme: source branch

This `source` branch contains pelican files for generating the 
`gh-pages` branch of the scurvy knave pelican theme.

The `gh-pages` branch is the live Github Pages page 
showing off how the Survy Knave theme actually looks.

The `master` branch contains the actual files for the 
scurvy-knave theme, and is what most people will want.
